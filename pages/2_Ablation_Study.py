### Why Conduct an Ablation Study?
An ablation study is a process of systematically removing parts of a model to understand the contribution of each component to the overall performance. For this project, I tested three variations of the `FetalNet` model against the baseline and the final fine-tuned model to justify the final architecture.

st.success(
    "The **Fine-Tuned Model** achieved the highest test accuracy (93.01%), confirming that the fine-tuning "
    "process was beneficial. The ablation studies showed that while all components contribute, the model "
    "architecture is robust. The slight performance drop in the ablated models justifies the inclusion of "
    "the SE Block and the full custom CNN head in the final design."
