### Objective
To scientifically validate the architecture of the `FetalNet` model, I conducted an ablation study. This process involves systematically removing or altering key components of the model and measuring the impact on performance. By comparing the results against the baseline and the final fine-tuned model, I can justify the inclusion of each component in the final design.

The following experiments were performed:
- **SE Block Removed:** The Squeeze-and-Excitation attention block was removed.
- **Second Conv Block Removed:** The second custom convolutional stage was removed to reduce model depth.
- **MaxPool Replaced with AvgPool:** The max pooling layer was swapped with an average pooling layer.

st.success(
    "The **Fine-Tuned Model** achieved the highest test accuracy at **93.01%**, confirming that the "
    "fine-tuning process was beneficial. The ablation experiments showed that while removing components "
    "resulted in a slight performance drop compared to the fine-tuned version, they still performed "
    "better than the original baseline. This indicates that while the architecture is robust, each component "
    "provides a positive contribution to achieving the best possible result."
